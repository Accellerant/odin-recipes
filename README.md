Assignment: Odin Project "Odin Recipes"

The overall purpose of this assignment is to take all 
the things I have learned thusfar with the odin project
and apply it to creating a simple web page. 

The skills which will be demostrated are as such:
    * Utilizing Git and GitHub

        ** Cloning a Repository from GitHub
        ** Using basic commands such as add, status, remote, commit,
                log, and push.
        ** Learning how to write good atomic commits.
        ** Remembering the general workflow:
                Modify -> Stage -> Commit.
        ** Pushing Commits early and often! 
                (Best when there's a meaningful change)

    * Utilizing Basic HTML Skills:

        ** HTML Boilerplate
        ** Paragraph Tag
        ** Header Tag
        ** Strong Tag
        ** Emphasis Tag
        ** Comments
        ** Lists - Ordered & Unordered
        ** Links and Images
